Title - The Covid-19 Distributed Sudoku

Description

 I was one of the distributed sudoku folks; I based my project off of some of the stuff that we had worked with in Assignment 3

Distributed Systems Problem 1

    Data representation - switching from gRPC to wirepickle, which uses pickle to create RPC functionality in python natively

Distributed Systems Problem 2

   Coordination - originally I planned for each node to only hold the square that it was responsible for. It was a lot easier for each node to keep a copy of the grid instead
    

Testing for Success

    Unit testing using the python unittest package
